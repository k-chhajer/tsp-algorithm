# üöö Travelling Salesman Problem with Vehicle Routing (ECE297 M4)

This project solves a variation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) tailored for a courier company with multiple delivery tasks and depots. The goal is to determine an efficient route that starts and ends at a depot, icks up and drops off packages in a valid order and minimizes the total travel time, considering turn pernalties, node connectivity and other real world constraints.

## üì¶ Problem Overview

## ‚úÖ Constraints and Assumptions

- Solution must make all deliveries in valid order (package must be picked up before dropped off)
- A single visit to pickup/dropoff intersection is sufficient for multiple packages
- Route must start and end at any depot
- If no valid route exists, return an empty vector
- Solution must be returned within **50 seconds of wall clock time**
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è  Algorithm Pipeline

### **1. Input Preprocessing**
  - Nodes are classified as:
    - ```depotType:``` Starting/ending points
    - ```pickupType``` and ```dropoffType:``` Delivery pairs
  - Nodes are indexed: ```0..depots```, ```depots..depots+pickups```, ```depots+pickups...depots+pickups+dropoffs```
### **2. Distance Matrix Generation**
  - Uses multi-threaded Dijkstra with A* to compute travel times between all nodes
    - Turn penalties included
    - Results stored in a ```dist[i][j]``` matrix for fast lookup
### **3. Initial Path Construction**
  - Applies **regret insertion heuristic**:
    - Greedily insert pickup/dropoff pairs with the highest regret (difference between best and second-best insertion)
    - Chooses best depot pair for start and end based on overall cost
### **4. Route Refinement**
  - Run **2-opt**, **3-opt**, and **4-opt** moves while ensuring pickup-before-dropoff constraints
  - Use **shake2** perturbation to escape local optima by swapping delivery pairs
  - Optimize 3-opt and 4-opt using Multi-threading
  - Keep optimizing till wall clock of 50 seconds is reached (in practice this was kept it till 48 seconds to allow time to preprocess and return final output)
### **5. Final Path Construction**
  - Remove consecutive duplicate intersections
  - Construct valid subpaths using ```findPathBetweenIntersections()```
  - Return result as a list of ```CourierSubPath``` objects
